# Soul-Guardian
"A tremor shakes the trees. Something stirs in the forest. The last guardian awakens and runs to the clearing where the relic awaits. They have arrived, they have found it again...  

Hordes of enemies are summoned and march, drawn by the power of the obelisk. The guardian is alone, but he will fight to the end to protect the souls of the forest. How many waves can he withstand?"
